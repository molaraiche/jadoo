## 🌐 Demo

Here is a working live demo: <https://jado.molaraiche.com//>

## 📝 Description

Welcome to my project! Here, I'll provide you with a brief overview of what inspired me to create it, why it solves a problem, and what I've learned throughout its development.

- Motivation & Why I Built This Project:
I built this project to enhance my skills in Tailwind CSS, Next.js, and TypeScript, while creating a visually engaging landing page titled "Best Destinations around the World." The goal was to inspire users to travel and explore new experiences through a modern and user-friendly platform.

- Problem Solved:
The landing page addresses the challenge of showcasing travel destinations in a captivating and intuitive way, improving upon the outdated designs found on many travel websites. It offers a visually appealing, responsive platform that enhances user engagement.

- What I Learned:
I gained experience in building responsive layouts with Tailwind CSS and integrating it with Next.js and TypeScript. This project helped me improve my skills in creating fast-loading, scalable pages with reusable components, while balancing aesthetics and performance.
